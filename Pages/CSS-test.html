    <h1>Testing display of HTML elements</h1>
    <a href="baotinkk.com" class="HeaderH5">Test</a>
    <p>
      This page contains a bunch of HTML Elements and text. You can copy the
      source code and use it test out various CSS Properties. For testing
      purposes, you may use
      <dfn
        >internal styles. Recall that these CSS rules are placed in between the
        <code>head</code> tags using the following format:</dfn
      >
    </p>

    <code>
      <pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  selector {
	property: value
  }
&lt;/style&gt;</pre
      >
    </code>

    <h1>This is 1st level heading</h1>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h2>This is 2nd level heading</h2>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h3>This is 3rd level heading</h3>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h4>This is 4th level heading</h4>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h5>This is 5th level heading</h5>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>
    <h6>This is 6th level heading</h6>
    <p>This is a test paragraph.</p>

    <h2>Basic block level elements</h2>

    <p>
      This is a normal paragraph (<code>p</code> element). To add some length to
      it, let us mention that this page was primarily written for testing the
      effect of <strong>user style sheets</strong>. You can use it for various
      other purposes as well, like just checking how your browser displays
      various HTML elements.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is another paragraph.
      <mark
        >I think it needs to be added that the set of elements tested is not
        exhaustive in any sense.</mark
      >
      I have selected those elements for which it can make sense to write user
      style sheet rules, in my opinion.
    </p>

    <div>
      This is a <code>div</code> element. Authors may use such elements instead
      of paragraph markup for various reasons. (End of <code>div</code>.)
    </div>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This is a <i>block quotation</i> containing a single paragraph. Well,
        not quite, since this is not <em>really</em> quoted text, but I hope you
        understand the point. After all, this page does not use HTML markup very
        normally anyway.

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph before an <strong>unordered</strong> list
      (<code>ul</code>). Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list
      before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't
      guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list
      header".
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>One.</li>
      <li>Two.</li>
      <li>
        Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for
        short items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas
        for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between
        items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Four. This is the last item in this list Let us terminate the list now
        without making any more fuss about it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph before a <strong>ordered</strong> list
      (<code>ol</code>). Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list
      before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't
      guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list
      header".

      <li>One.</li>

        items are short, lists look better if they are compactly presented,

        between items.

        Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list now
        without making any more fuss about it.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph before a <strong>definition</strong> list
      (<code>dl</code>). In principle, such a list should consist of
      <em>terms</em> and associated definitions. But many authors use
      <code>dl</code> elements for fancy "layout" things. Usually the effect is
      not <em>too</em> bad, if you design user style sheet rules for
      <code>dl</code> which are suitable for real definition lists.
