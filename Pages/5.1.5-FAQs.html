      <h4>Can I cancel my order before it is shipped out?</h4>

      <p>
        Buyers can only request for cancellation once for every order. As such,
        once your request is rejected or withdrawn, you would not be able to
        submit another cancellation request for the same order. <br />Once you
        have requested for order cancellation, the seller is to respond to your
        cancellation request within 2 days (48 hours); If the seller fails to
        respond to the cancellation within that time frame, the order will be
        automatically cancelled by the system and you will be refunded
        accordingly:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Credit/Debit Card - 7 to 14 working days</li>
        <li>ShopeePay - 24 hours</li>
        <li>PayNow - 24 hours</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can cancel your order by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tapping on Cancel Order in the Order Details page.</li>
        <li>Choose a cancellation reason.</li>
        <li>Confirm to proceed with the cancellation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>When and how will I receive my refund?</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For local sellers</strong> Once you have returned the item to
        the seller, the seller will check and acknowledge the return of the
        goods. Your refund will be processed if there is no further discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For overseas sellers</strong> Once our dispute team concluded
        the inspection of the return/refund requested or the seller accepted the
        proposed return/refund amount, you will be notified of the outcome via
        in-app push notification and email.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For Mall sellers </strong>Once you have returned the item to
        Shopee Warehouse, the parcel will go through Quality Check (QC) by our
        team. Your return/refund request will be processed within 7-9 working
        days and you will be notified of the outcome via in-app push
        notification and email.
      </p>
      <p>The refund process is different for each payment method used:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Credit / debit card</strong> - Refunds will be credited back
          into your debit/credit card within 7-14 working days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-debit / credit card</strong>
          - Payments will be refunded to your ShopeePay within 24 hours. If you
          have yet to set up ShopeePay, you will be prompted to set it up within
          72 hours. If your ShopeePay is not activated after 72 hours, payment
          will be returned directly to your bank account.
